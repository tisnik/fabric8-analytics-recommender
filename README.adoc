= Fabric8-Analytics Recommender

_Note on naming: The Fabric8-Analytics project has evolved from 2 different projects called "cucos" and "bayesian". We're currently in process of renaming the modules and updating documentation. Until that is completed, please consider "cucos" and "bayesian" to be synonyms of "Fabric8-Analytics"._

== Instructions

Clone Fabric8-Analytics Analytics repository
----
git clone git@github.com:fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-recommender.git
cd Analytics/models

Recommender can have multiple machine-learning models. Currently, it has only one model that is based on the idea of
similarity with frequent patterns. A model should be trained with training data and that is an offline job. Once we have
a model, we score it to generate recommendations for the given user request. That is online activity. Accordingly, the
folder structure has been setup. Let us discuss these training and scoring activities in more details now.

== Training: Train ML model with training data
The training job happens in a 'serverless' way i.e. the AWS EMR cluster is setup on the fly and training job is
submitted to that. This cluster goes away as soon as the training job is over ! This helps minimize AWS consumption that
is very expensive.

The current model finds frequent patterns i.e. set of software-packages that are used together most frequently in the
given training data. These frequent patterns are then stored inside a Titan graph. So, you need to setup Titan graph
database before running the training.

Once you have graph database ready, you can specify AWS credentials and HTTP URL for Titan graph database server in the
docker-compose-analytics-training.yml file and submit the training job as follows:
----
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-analytics-training.yml build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-analytics-training.yml up
----

This will return AWS job id that can be used to track the training job on AWS EMR cluster.

== Scoring: Run the recommendation service
Online scoring is performed by way of invoking stack-analyses API call on server.
A user can follow https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-server[fabric8-analytics-server] setup and then do

----
$ curl -XPOST "manifest[]=@<path_to_manifest_file>" "http://127.0.0.1:32000/api/v1/stack-analyses"
